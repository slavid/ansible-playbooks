# Ansible OpenVPN

Turn any Raspberry Pi into a VPN gateway for your home devices!

## Motivation
My personal usecase is that I have a Smart TV that does not have any VPN app available and want to watch live TV from other countries and my router does not have VPN capabilities, so with this solution I can connect my TV to other countries and have a public IP of that country so that I do not get geo-blocked.
